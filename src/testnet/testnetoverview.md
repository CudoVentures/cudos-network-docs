# Overview

This guide will take you through the process of building nodes that will participate in the Cudos testnet blockchain.

If you are looking for a quick way to begin testing NFTs and Smart Contracts on the test network you may want to build a *Standalone Node*, however for more security it is recommended that you build a *Validator Cluster* of nodes.

All Cudos nodes run the cudos-noded software, and are initially built as Full nodes. A node can either remain as a Full node only, or can take on one of the roles mentioned below, according to how they are configured. 


A **Standalone Node** is just a full node, and offers a quick way to test your NFTs and smart contracts against the Cudos testnet blockchain. The **Standalone Validator** is a Standalone Node acting as a validator. A Standalone Node/Validator is less secure than a Validator cluster.

A **Validator Cluster** consists of *Validator*, *Sentry* and optionally *Seed* nodes. 

For more information on Node types, please refer to the [Validators](/learn/validators.html#overview) section.




The cudos-noded software is supported on **Debian 10, Ubuntu, WSL,** and **macOS Catalina version 10.15.4 or above**.
