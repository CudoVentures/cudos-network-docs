# Introduction

This guide will take you through the process of building nodes that will participate in the Cudos testnet blockchain.

If you are looking for a quick way to begin testing NFTs and Smart Contracts on the test network you may want to build a *Standalone Node*, however for more security it is recommended that you build a *Validator Cluster* of nodes.

All cudos nodes run the cudos-noded software, and are initially built as Full nodes. A node can either remain as a Full node only, or can take on one of the roles described in the next section, according to how they are configured. 

The cudos-noded software is supported on **Debian 10, Ubuntu, WSL,** and **macOS Catalina version 10.15.4 or above**.  Please also refer to the Hardware Requirements section.
