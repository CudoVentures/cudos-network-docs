# Cudos network overview

## General overview

The Cudos Network is a special-purpose blockchain designed to provide high-performance, trustless, and permissionless cloud computing for all. Consensus on the network is achieved by using the Tendermint Core and its Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) algorithm. In addition to leveraging Tendermint Core, the Cudos Network is supported by the Cosmos SDK to achieve high throughput, availability, and security. The promise of computing, which is core to the Cudos Network’s mission, is also expanded beyond Cosmos-based blockchains through bespoke bridges and cryptographic approaches to cross-chain interoperability. While Ethereum is the first Layer-1 blockchain we plan to interoperate during our Mainnet launch, we plan to expand our compute offering to a wider array of networks.

Developers, individuals, and businesses will deploy next-generation smart contracts that leverage CosmWasm (and later EVM via Ethermint) with equal security assurances to traditional blockchain networks on the Cudos Network. The added benefits are faster transaction speeds and fundamentally lower transaction costs. This will allow Cudos to fulfil its mission of providing an extra computing layer to blockchains, unlocking an extensive array of additional use cases for which high-performance computing power is needed.

This higher level of performance and security is possible thanks to the Cudos Blockchain’s ability to leverage a strong community of Validators with a robust node infrastructure. This gives users of the Cudos Network a high level of confidence in the various enterprise and developer use cases that are subsequently deployed. What makes the Cudos Network stand out from other blockchains is the deep level of integration for high-performance computes capacity at the very core of the network.

Validators, meaning individuals who have financially committed funds through a process known as staking, notarize, and in fact validate, every transaction proposed onto the network with high availability and trust levels that are assessed in a real-time and predictive manner. The Cudos Network rewards the most well-performing Validators with a predictable income stream. It also rapidly removes misbehaving actors from its Proof of Stake network to assure a greater level of security for all participants. The combination of these factors incentivise any individual today, from investors to data-centre or compute infrastructure providers, to interact reliably on the Cudos Network to buy or sell compute capacity at scale.
