# ﻿Funding your Wallet

A wallet allows you to store and retrieve CUDOS tokens. When you buy or receive CUDOS tokens then you can store them in a wallet and start different transactions. Owning CUDOS will provide you with more options such as using your tokens to become a validator/delegator and participate in staking more tokens.

This article explains where to buy/trade CUDOS and how to apply for grants.
