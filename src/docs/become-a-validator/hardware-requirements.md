## Hardware minimum recommended specs

The following are the minimum hardware requirements Validators will need to run to successfully join and operate on the Cudos Network for the Testnet and Mainnet (Version 1) stage:

### Cudos mainnet ("Ingenii") Validator node

* Intel Xeon ('Skylake-SP' or newer) processor ‑or‑ AMD Epyc ('Naples' or newer) processor – Requires SGX ‑or‑ SEV feature, as well as AVX and AES-NI feature – Minimum model ≥8 cores at ≥2.0 GHz required (≥16 cores preferred)
* 32GiB ECC system memory (≥64GiB preferred)
* ≥2TB NVMe SSD - RAID1 or better resilience required (RAID 1+0 performance preferred) – High DWPD/TBW endurance drives strongly recommended
* Redundancy of server power and cooling components is strongly recommended
* Private 1Gb/s or 10Gb/s internal network for peer node connections
'Four‑nines' availability target or better
* Linux Debian 10

### Cudos mainnet ("Ingenii") Sentry node

* Intel Xeon ('Haswell' or newer) processor ‑or‑ AMD Opteron/Epyc ('Toronto' or newer) processor – Minimum model ≥4 cores at ≥2.0 GHz required (≥8 cores preferred)
* ≥16GiB ECC system memory
* ≥500GB NVMe SSD - RAID1 or better resilience required
* Redundancy of server power and cooling components is strongly recommended
* Private 1Gb/s or 10Gb/s internal network for peer node connections
* 1Gb/s internet connection (≥2.5Gb/s preferred)
* Publicly accessible IPv4 address (additionally IPv6 recommended)
* Anti-DDoS protection is strongly recommended
'Four‑nines' availability target or better
* Linux Debian 10

### Cudos public testnet ("Somniorum") Validator node

* Intel Xeon ('Skylake-SP' or newer) processor ‑or‑ AMD Epyc ('Naples' or newer) processor – Requires SGX ‑or‑ SEV feature, as well as AVX and AES-NI feature – Minimum model ≥8 cores at ≥2.0 GHz required (≥16 cores preferred)
* 32GiB ECC system memory (≥64GiB preferred)
* ≥2TB NVMe SSD - RAID1 or better resilience recommended
* Private 1Gb/s or 10Gb/s internal network for peer node connections
* Linux Debian 10

### Cudos public testnet ("Somniorum") Sentry node

* Intel Xeon ('Haswell' or newer) processor ‑or‑ AMD Opteron/Epyc ('Toronto' or newer) processor – Minimum model ≥4 cores at ≥2.0 GHz required (≥8 cores preferred)
* ≥16GiB ECC system memory
* ≥500GB NVMe SSD - RAID1 or better resilience recommended
* Private 1Gb/s or 10Gb/s internal network for peer node connections
* 1Gb/s internet connection (≥2.5Gb/s preferred)
* Publicly accessible IPv4 address (additionally IPv6 recommended)
* Linux Debian 10

As the network evolves and the Cudos community receives more feedback on the above, we expect these figures to be updated and communicated to network stakeholders on an ongoing basis.
