title: Rewards and Delegated Staking

## Rewards

Validators play a special role in the Cudos Network’s day-to-day workings. They accept transactions, validate blocks, and interact with other stakeholders in various Governance votes that ensure the network’s security, integrity and viability on an ongoing basis.

As part of that, Validators run and execute smart contracts, which are one of the key aspects of the network, and coordinate the triggering and execution of computing workloads. Thus, the network’s health heavily depends on Validators being highly available and performant, and also on the early identification of any dangerous and harmful behaviors performed by bad actors.

Validators earn several types of standard rewards, in addition to one-off additional ones:

* They earn Staking Rewards to incentivize their crypto-economic contributions to the network over time.
* They earn a commission on the stake delegated through them, as part of the delegated proof of stake mechanism, from any users who do not run infrastructure for the network but want to support it and its security.
* They earn gas fees.

After the mainnet is launched and the network gains traction, staking rewards will become a secondary source of revenue, and network fees will become the main one.

## Mainnet Validators

Once the Cudos Network mainnet is deployed Validators (and stakers) staked in Ethereum will be migrated from Ethereum Staking to full PoS staking in the network. Balances will be converted to the native CUDOS token and Validators staked will begin processing blocks for the network. At this point, Validators will need to be running Cudos nodes with appropriate hardware to maintain the network and validate transactions.

Cudos is also finalizing the architecture of the compute capabilities of the network. We will communicate in the near future how the compute offering will integrate into the network and any extra hardware requirements that will be required to run compute jobs.

In order to incentivize the highest level of security, availability, and economic integrity on the network, the Cudos Network blockchain penalizes adverse behaviors, and the node operators or Validators linked to these, programmatically. The types of penalties a Validator can incur on the network have several levels of severity; some may lead to immediate irreversible exclusion at cost, others may lead to time-outs from additional Staking rewards. Cudos as a team is working to ensure that these metrics are real-time and accurately predictive to guarantee that strictly the highest quality of computing power is offered on Cudos Network.

## Delegated Staking and Rewards

The Cudos network will support delegated staking through the Validators. The Validators earn a fee on the rewards of the users who delegated the stake through them. This fee is freely choosable by each Validator, however, it will always need to be above a minimum predefined value, which is set for security reasons. This minimum will be set to 2% to start with.

Any user with CUDOS tokens, including Validators, can delegate their stake through a Validator. One wallet can delegate the stake to more than one Validator.

All staking participants earn rewards individually based on their stake size. Each staking participant receives the percentage of the rewards that is equal to the percentage of the total stake that they own. This means, for example, if a total of 500 tokens are staked by users, and if one of the users staked 50 tokens, then this user gets 50/500 = 10% of the total rewards being distributed if we do not take the commissions into account.

Rather than staking all tokens in a Validator hosted by the project, Cudos will stake some tokens delegating them to other Validators in the network, to further enhance the revenue streams for these Validators. We will share more details on this shortly, but it is expected that the project will delegate an amount of the same order of magnitude to the minimum stake for a Validator.
