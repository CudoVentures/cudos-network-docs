During the Cudos Public 'Somniorum' Testnet we will be running our incentive programme Project Artemis. We're inviting the Cudos community to help contribute towards the testing to help move the network closer to mainnet. To help maximise participation in our public testnet and to get the best feedback we're offering token rewards to users who join us and fulfil some key testing tasks.

During Project Artemis participants are able to earn CUDOS by completing tasks. Once our mainnet is deployed participants of Project Artemis will have native CUDOS airdropped to their wallets as reward for their contributions.

Project Artemis is broken down into 4 key phases which will run sequentially, find more details of each below:

## Testnet Phases

### Phase 1 - Apollo

Starter setup tasks for Cudos Network onboarding for Validators and users, focussing on account creation, hardware provisioning, node syncing and the CUDOS faucet.

### Phase 2 - Buzz (Launching Soon)

Test all aspects of Validation, including staking, delegated staking, rewards. Additionally exploring CosmWasm smart contracts including: contract interaction, contract deployment, contract interfaces. Testing of our Gravity bridge implementation with Rinkeby Ethereum.

### Phase 3 - Armstrong (Launching Soon)

Adversarial stress tests bringing a coordinated strike to bring as much diversity in transaction activity as possible to the Cudos Network. Validators will run network load and performing maintenance tasks.

## How to Participate

Take a look at the [active tasks](#tasks) for the current phase and dive into the Somniorum Testnet.

Upon completion of each task please submit your evidence to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsGDUvtF70O1LLMWsKhNTVmiW_HzodGDFRgW-6YLYloA3hdg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Tasks will be monitored and validated on-chain for completion.

## CUDOS Airdrop

CUDOS tokens will be distributed to Project Artemis participants when the Cudos Network mainnet is deployed, the same wallet addresses used for testnet *must* be retained to ensure access to your airdrop account.

Details of which users have qualified for CUDOS rewards will be revealed when each phase concludes.
