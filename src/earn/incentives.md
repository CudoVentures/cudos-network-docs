During the Cudos Public Testnet we will be running our incentive programme Project Artemis. We're inviting the Cudos community to help contribute towards the testing to help move the network closer to mainnet. To help maximise participation in our public testnet and to get the best feedback we're offering token rewards to users who join us and fulfil some key testing tasks.

During Project Artemis participants will earn points by completing tasks. Once our mainnet is deployed participants of Project Artemis will have native CUDOS airdropped to their wallets as reward for their contributions.

As the public testing phases progress we'll be posting more detail on rewards and community progress here.

## Testnet Phases

Project Artemis consists of 4 key phases:

**Phase 1 - Apollo: Setup**

Starter tasks for Cudos Network onboarding for Validators and users, focussing on account creation, hardware provisioning, node syncing and the CUDOS faucet

**Phase 2 - Buzz: Platform Testing**

Test all aspects of Validation, including staking, delegated staking, rewards. Additionally exploring CosmWasm smart contracts including: contract interaction, contract deployment, contract interfaces. Testing of our Gravity bridge implementation with Rinkeby Ethereum.

**Phase 3 - Armstrong: Adversarial Stress Test**

A coordinated strike to bring as much diversity in transaction activity as possible to the Cudos Network. Validators will run network load and performing maintenance tasks.

**Phase 4 - ?: Migration Testing**

Dry-run of our genesis and migration plan for the new native Cudos Network
