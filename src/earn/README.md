## Earning CUDOS

There are several ways to use the Cudos Network to earn CUDOS

### Validate

[Become a Cudos Validator](/build/validator.html) and earn CUDOS from transactions. This is the best way to earn yields on your CUDOS, but requires active participation in securing the network.

### Delegate

[Stake your CUDOS](/earn/staking.html#validator-rewards) with a Validator to earn a portion of their transaction rewards. This is the easiest way for any CUDOS holder to not only further secure the network, but also earn yields with their tokens.

### Participate

Join our incentive testnet programme [Project Artemis](/earn/incentives.html) to complete tasks and earn CUDOS rewards. Or alternately just start developing on the Cudos Network with your own custom smart contracts that leverage scalable compute.
