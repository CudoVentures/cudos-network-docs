## Delegated staking and rewards

The Cudos network will support delegated staking through the Validators. The Validators earn a proportion of the rewards of the users who delegated the staked through them. Each Validator can freely choose the fee. However, it will always need to be above a predefined minimum value set for security reasons. This minimum will be 2% at the start.

Any user with CUDOS tokens, including Validators, can delegate their stake through a Validator. One wallet can delegate the stake to more than one Validator.

All staking participants earn rewards individually based on their staked amount. Each staking participant receives the percentage of the rewards proportional to the percentage of the total stake they own. For example, if a total of 500 tokens are staked by users, and if one of the users staked 50 tokens, then this user gets 50/500 = 10% of the total rewards being distributed (excluding commissions).

Rather than staking all tokens in a Validator hosted by the project, Cudos will stake some tokens delegating them to other Validators in the network. This will enhance the revenue streams for these Validators further. We will share more details on this shortly, but expect the project to delegate an amount similar to the minimum stake for a Validator.

### Delegated staking

#### What is delegated staking

Recently, most networks that require the nodes to stake also allow delegated staking. The concept is completely analogous: the nodes of the network stake a certain amount of tokens in order to qualify to be a node, and get rewarded accordingly. For users willing to stake tokens but not necessarily wanting to host a full node, there is the possibility to stake in one of the aforementioned nodes, in order to support it and the network. This is what is commonly understood by delegated staking, and also gives rewards for the contribution.

#### How to stake via a validator

In order to delegate your stake via a validator you will need the funds you want to delegate and to decide to which validator node you want to delegate the stake to. Once that is done, you can either follow the process for a staking provider, or the instructions that we will be updating on this page soon.

#### Staking pool and provider fees

While all staking rewards are the same, the final amount for users delegating their stake will likely be lower, as the staking providers keep a percentage of the staking rewards that result from tokens delegated to them. This percentage will be choosable by each staking provider, and thus might vary from one to another.

#### Which staking providers can you choose

There are currently multiple staking providers that are coming onboard, and there will be a diversity of offerings by launch time. A list will be published soon. If you are interested in becoming a staking provider for CUDOS, [apply here](https://www.cudos.org/#contact-us).
