3. Either create a new account or import an already existing account with the mnemonic phrase that you got from the previous step of creating an account. Note that currently the wallet is not connected to the cudos-network, so it will not show the correct info for that account on the cudos-network.
4. You can use the wallet to get the address to wire tokens to your account by clicking on the upper side of the extension window.
