# ﻿Funding your Wallet

A wallet allows you to store and retrieve CUDOS tokens. When you buy or receive CUDOS tokens, you can keep them in a wallet and start different transactions. Owning CUDOS will provide you with more options, such as using your tokens to become a validator/delegator and participate in staking.

This article explains where to buy/trade CUDOS and how to apply for grants.
