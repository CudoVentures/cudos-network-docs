# Delegated staking

## What is delegated staking

Recently, most networks that require the nodes to stake also allow delegated staking. The concept is completely analogous: the nodes of the network stake a certain amount of tokens in order to qualify to be a node, and get rewarded accordingly. For users willing to stake tokens but not necessarily wanting to host a full node, there is the possibility to stake in one of the aforementioned nodes, in order to support it and the network. This is what is commonly understood by delegated staking, and also gives rewards for the contribution.

## How to stake via a validator

In order to delegate your stake via a validator you will need the funds you want to delegate and to decide to which validator node you want to delegate the stake to. Once that is done, you can either follow the process for a staking provider, or the instructions that we will be updating on this page soon.

## Staking pool and provider fees

While all staking rewards are the same, the final amount for users delegating their stake will likely be lower, as the staking providers keep a percentage of the staking rewards that result from tokens delegated to them. This percentage will be choosable by each staking provider, and thus might vary from one to another.

## Which staking providers can you choose

There are currently multiple staking providers that are coming onboard, and there will be a diversity of offerings by launch time. A list will be published soon. If you are interested in becoming a staking provider for CUDOS, [apply here](https://www.cudos.org/#contact-us).
