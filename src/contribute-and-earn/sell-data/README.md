# Sell data

## How to sell data

CUDOS is a bridge between the outside world and blockchains. Anyone who wants to sell their off-chain data to be used in blockchains, for instance currency pair prices to be used for DeFi, can do so directly via a CUDOS dapp. This connects directly the seller of data with the resources using it, the smart contracts in a layer 1 blockchain, providing great value to both sides.

Please get in touch with us using [this application form](https://www.cudos.org/#contact-us) if you’re interested in selling data for blockchains.
