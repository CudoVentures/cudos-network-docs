# Earn by building on CUDOS

## Publish to CUDOS marketplace

The CUDOS marketplace allows developers to choose template code for a specific use case, and call it through the CUDOS smart contract. These may include data feeds such as cryptocurrency pair prices or other workloads that might be not possible or too expensive to run on the layer 1, such as random number generators.

### Get other developers to use your dapps

Developers that contribute by writing dapps for the CUDOS marketplace will be rewarded based on how successful the dapp is. In other words, CUDOS will give the writer of the dapp a portion of the transaction fees that are created using their dapp. Please get in touch with us using [this application form](https://www.cudos.org/#contact-us) if youâ€™re interested in developing dapps for CUDOS.

### Examples

First Dapps to go live are:

- Cryptocompare - One of the main Data Feed Providers in the Crypto pricing space
- Coinmarketcap - The main Data Feed Providers in the Crypto pricing space
- Verifiable Random number generator - Needed for many blockchain Dapps
- Formula Tester - Proof of scalability of compute
- Pi generator - Proof of scalability of compute
